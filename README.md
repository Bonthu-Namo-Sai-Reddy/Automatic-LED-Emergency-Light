🚀 Project Overview  
This Automatic LED Emergency Light system ensures reliable backup lighting during power outages. The circuit automatically detects the absence of AC mains power and instantly switches on LEDs using a rechargeable battery. Once power is restored, the system turns off the LEDs and resumes battery charging.

⚙️ Working Principle  
1️⃣ Normal Mode: When AC power is available, the battery charges, and LEDs remain OFF.  
2️⃣ Power Failure Mode: The circuit detects power loss and switches ON the LEDs automatically.  
3️⃣ Restoration Mode: When AC power is restored, LEDs turn OFF, and the battery resumes charging.  

🛠️ Features  
✔️ Automatic Switching – Detects power failure and turns on the LEDs instantly.  
✔️ Rechargeable Battery – Ensures continuous operation during outages.  
✔️ Energy Efficient – Uses LED lighting for minimal power consumption.  
✔️ Auto-Charging System – Battery recharges when AC mains is available.  
✔️ Compact & Cost-Effective – Simple design with readily available components.  

🔧 Components Used  
🔹 Step-Down Transformer – Converts AC mains voltage to low DC voltage.  
🔹 Bridge Rectifier – Converts AC power to DC for circuit operation.  
🔹 Voltage Regulator (LM317) – Ensures stable power supply to the LEDs.  
🔹 Transistors (BC548, BC337) – Controls automatic switching.  
🔹 Resistors & Capacitors – For proper circuit operation.  
🔹 LEDs – Emergency lighting source.  
🔹 Rechargeable Battery (12V) – Provides backup power.  

🛠️ Installation & Setup  
🔹 Step 1: Assemble the circuit on a breadboard or PCB.  
🔹 Step 2: Connect the AC mains power source.  
🔹 Step 3: Attach the rechargeable battery and LED setup.  
🔹 Step 4: The system will now automatically function as an emergency light.  

🔮 Future Enhancements  
✨ Solar Charging: Integrate a solar panel for renewable power.  
✨ Brightness Control: Adjust LED brightness based on battery level.  
✨ Microcontroller Integration: Use Arduino for advanced control and monitoring.
